            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup ice water</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add 2 1/4 cups flour, 2 tbsp sugar, and 1/2tsp salt to a food processor. Pulse to combine.</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup unsalted butter, cut into cubes. Pulse until only pea-sized pieces of butter remain. This shouldnâ€™t take too long.</li>
                <li>Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Drizzle 1/2 cup of ice water over the mixture. I like to use a spatula at first to mix everything together since I find that it is the most sticky at this point. Then once things start to combine, I use my hands to mix thoroughly to knead a bit until no dry spots remain and the dough stays together.</li>
                <li>Cut the dough in half. I like to weigh them at this point to make sure that they are equal. Then wrap them tightly in plastic wrap. I use a small rolling pin to flatten them and spread them around a bit. </li>
                <li>Place them in a refrigerator for at least an hour. I usually make this dough the night before and leave them to chill overnight.</li>
            </ol>
